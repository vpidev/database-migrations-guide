# Installation

The Migration Tool is called [RoundhousE](https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse).

The version we are using will be located on the U drive.

1. Copy ```rh.exe``` from ```\\vpinc.net\drives\UserDrive\IT\Software\Development_Tools\RoundhousE``` to your machine and place somewhere safe.
